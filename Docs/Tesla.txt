Tesla's financial performance

Tesla's paid-in capital makes up the accumulated deficit to maintain its operation
Tesla, Inc. (formerly Tesla Motors, Inc.), is an American automotive and energy company based in Palo Alto, California.[8] The company specializes in electric car manufacturing and, through its SolarCity subsidiary, solar panel manufacturing.[9] It operates multiple production and assembly plants, such as Gigafactory 1[10] near Reno, Nevada, and its main vehicle manufacturing facility at Tesla Factory[11] in Fremont, California. As of 2019, Tesla sells Model S,[12] Model X,[13] and Model 3 cars.[14] It is accepting reservations for the Model Y,[15] Roadster (2020),[16], Cybertruck,[17] and Semi[18] vehicles. Tesla also sells Powerwall,[19] Powerpack,[20] and Megapack[21] batteries, solar panels,[22] solar roof tiles,[23] and some related products.

Tesla was founded in July 2003, by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, under the name Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to engineer Nikola Tesla. In early Series A funding, Tesla Motors was joined by Elon Musk, J. B. Straubel and Ian Wright, all of whom are retroactively allowed to call themselves co-founders of the company. Musk, who formerly served as chairman and is the current chief executive officer, said that he envisioned Tesla Motors as a technology company and independent automaker, aimed at eventually offering electric cars at prices affordable to the average consumer. Tesla Motors shortened its name to Tesla in February 2017.

After 10 years in the market, Tesla ranked as the world's best selling plug-in passenger car manufacturer in 2018, both as a brand and by automotive group, with 245,240 units delivered and a market share of 12% of the plug-in segment sales.[24][25][26] Tesla vehicle sales in the U.S. increased by 280% from 48,000 in 2017 to 182,400 in 2018,[27] and globally were up by 138% from 2017.[28] Tesla has never had a profitable year.[29] However, it has had several profitable quarters starting from the first quarter of 2013 when it posted an $11 million profit.

History
Main article: History of Tesla, Inc.
Tesla Motors was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[30] The founders were influenced to start the company after GM recalled all its EV1 electric cars in 2003 and then destroyed them.[31] Elon Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman. Tesla's primary goal was to commercialize electric vehicles, starting with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then moving into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[32]

Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level.[33] In addition to his daily operational roles, Musk was the controlling investor in Tesla from the first financing round, funding $6.5M of the Series A capital investment round of US$7.5 million with personal funds.[citation needed] Musk later led Tesla Motors' Series B, $9M of US$13 million, and co-led the third, $12M of US$40 million round in May 2006. Tesla's third round included investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin & Larry Page, former eBay President Jeff Skoll, Hyatt heir Nick Pritzker and added the VC firms Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Capricorn Management and The Bay Area Equity Fund managed by JPMorgan Chase.[34] The fourth round in May 2007 added another US$45 million and brought the total investments to over US$105 million through private financing.[35]

Tesla has been reporting net losses most quarters for many years. In 3Q2019, Tesla surprised analysts, who had been anticipating a quarterly loss of approximately 40 cents per share, with adjusted earnings of US$1.61 per share, on total quarterly revenue of US$6.3 billion.[36]

Strategy

Tesla strategy of starting with low-volume high-priced cars and evolving to higher-volume lower-priced cars.[32]
Tesla's business strategy is to emulate typical technological-product life cycles and initially target affluent buyers, and then move into larger markets at lower price points.[32][37] The battery and electric drivetrain technology for each model would be developed and partially paid for through the sales of earlier models.[32][38] The Roadster was low-volume and priced at US$109,000. Model S and Model X targeted the broader luxury market. Model 3 and the Model Y is aimed at a higher-volume segment.[39][40] This business strategy is common in the technology industry.[41] According to a Musk blog post, "New technology in any field takes a few versions to optimize before reaching the mass market, and in this case it is competing with 150 years and trillions of dollars spent on gasoline cars."[42]


Robotic manufacturing of the Model S at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California
Tesla's production strategy includes a high degree of vertical integration[43] (80% in 2016[44]), which includes component production and proprietary charging infrastructure. The company operates large factories to capture economies of scale. Tesla builds electric powertrain components for vehicles from other automakers, including the Smart ED2 ForTwo electric drive (the lowest-priced car from Daimler AG), the Toyota RAV4 EV, and Freightliner's Custom Chassis Electric Van. Vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers,[45] and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[46][47]


The Tesla Patent Wall at its headquarters was removed after the company announced its patents are part of the open source movement.[48]
Tesla's sales strategy is to sell its vehicles online and in company-owned showrooms rather than through a conventional dealer network. Moving towards an e-commerce strategy, customers are able to customize and order their vehicles online.[49][50]

Tesla's technology strategy focuses on pure-electric propulsion technology, and transferring other approaches from the technology industry to transportation, such as online software updates.[51] Tesla allows its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith.[52] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[53] Tesla retained control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[54]

Tesla Human Resources VP Arnnon Geshuri committed to bringing manufacturing jobs "back to California".[55][56] In 2015, Geshuri led a hiring surge about which he said: "In the last 14 months we've had 1.5 million applications from around the world. People want to work here."[57] Geshuri emphasizes hiring veterans, saying "Veterans are a great source of talent for Tesla, and we're going after it."[56][58][59]

Sales
Tesla delivered 367,500 cars in 2019, 50% more than in 2018 and more than triple the number sold in 2017. At the end of 2019, Tesla's global sales since 2012 totaled over 891,000 units.[60][61][28] Year over year Tesla U.S. vehicle sales from 2017 to 2018 increased by 280% from 48,000 to 182,400.[27] As of October 2018, Tesla's sales represented about 20% of the all-electric cars on the world's roads, according to Navigant Research.[62] In July 2017, Tesla said their vehicles had traveled 5 billion miles (8 billion km).[63]

In 2016 BYD Auto was the world's top selling plug-in car manufacturer with 101,183 units sold, followed by Tesla with 76,243.[64][65] However, Tesla revenues ranked first with US$6.35 billion, while BYD notched US$3.88 billion.[66] Also in 2016, Tesla sold US$1 billion worth of cars in China, the world's largest market for electric vehicles, and in October of the following year it reached an agreement with the Chinese government to build a factory in Shanghai.[67]


Tesla was the world's best selling plug-in passenger car manufacturer in 2018.[24][25] Shown its entire line up as of 2019
After ranking third by brand in 2017, behind BYD and BAIC,[68][69] Tesla ranked as the world's best selling plug-in passenger car manufacturer in 2018, both as a brand and by automotive group, with 245,240 units delivered, capturing a market share of 12% of all plug-in cars sold globally in 2018,[24][25][26] followed by BYD Auto with 227,152 plug-in passenger cars delivered.[26][70]

In August of 2015, Tesla launched a revamp of its stores to include interactive displays focused on safety, autopilot, charging network and motors.[71] As of October 2016, Tesla operated about 260 galleries or retail locations in the United States.[72] In June 2016, Tesla opened its first store-within-a-store: a small outpost within the Nordstrom department store at The Grove shopping mall in Los Angeles.[73] In 2017, Tesla opened retail locations in Dubai and South Korea.[74]

Foreseeing Germany as its second market after the U.S. (and the largest in Europe), in 2016 Tesla stated the Dutch (Dienst Wegverkeer) RDW-issued Whole Vehicle Type Approval (WVTA) should be accepted as a legal compliance document, with no need to seek specific national type of approvals in EU member states.[75] In 2017 Tesla had a US$52 million marketing budget and used a referral program and word of mouth to attract buyers.[76][77]

 Eberhard and Tarpenning were the original founders and incorporated Tesla, while Musk, Straubel and Wright joined in a Series A round later on. A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five to call themselves founders.[2]
 Sales are only counted as sold when delivered to end customer and all paperwork is correct
 Goods in transit are produced but not counted as sold until delivered. Tesla no longer reports in transit numbers.
 Sales by model do not add up to total, these were preliminary figures reported by Tesla. Only total sales is final figures are reported by Tesla, as breakdown by model is not typically provided.
Tesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as ship availability and registration. Tesla does not follow the former auto industry standard of monthly reporting; GM and Ford changed from monthly to quarterly sales reporting in 2018 and 2019.[114] Some monthly sales are estimated by media.[115]

US dealership disputes
Main article: Tesla US dealership disputes

Tesla gallery in Austin, Texas
Tesla operates stores and galleries[116][117]â€”usually located in shopping mallsâ€”in many U.S. states. However, customers buy vehicles only from the Tesla website.[118][119][120][121] The stores serve as showrooms that allow people to learn about the company and its vehicles. Some galleries are located in states with restrictive dealer protection laws that prohibit discussing price, financing, and test drives, as well as other restrictions.

Tesla's strategy of direct customer sales and owning stores and service centers is different from the standard dealership model in the global vehicle marketplace. Tesla is the only automaker that sells cars directly to consumers; all others use independently owned dealerships,[122][123] although many provide online configuration and financing.[124][125][126] 48 states have laws that limit or ban manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers,[127][128][129] and although Tesla has no independent dealerships, dealership associations in multiple states have filed lawsuits over Tesla's sales practices.

Countries other than U.S. do not protect dealers. The Federal Trade Commission recommends allowing direct manufacturer sales,[130][131] which analysts believe would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[132][133]

In February 2019, Tesla announced that it would shut down the bulk of its stores and begin to sell cars exclusively through the internet.[134] The next month, the company reversed its decision, saying in a government filing that it would only close about half the number of showrooms it had originally intended to.[135]

Used vehicles
Under a buyback program called the Resale Value Guarantee available in 37 U.S. states, a Tesla Model S sold new before July 1, 2016 included the right to return it after three years with reimbursement of 43% to 50% of its initial price. This reimbursement matched the trade-in values of competitive German luxury cars of that age. In addition to maintaining the resale value, Tesla hoped to secure a supply of used cars to refurbish and re-sell with warranty. According to Automotive News, the profit margin on used car sales in the U.S. is about triple that on new cars, and Tesla's direct sales would allow them to capture resale profits.[136] Tesla ended the program in 2016, although they retained the Residual Value Guarantee on leased vehicles.[137][138][needs update]

In May 2015, Tesla started selling refurbished Model S cars in the U.S.[139] and within a month sold 1,600 cars.[140] As of July 2017, over 80 used Model S and Model X cars were for sale, with either a four-year, 50,000-mile warranty[141] or a two-year, 100,000-mile warranty for vehicles above 50,000 miles.[142][143] As of September 2015, similar programs existed in Canada,[144] Austria,[145] Belgium,[146] Denmark,[147] France,[148] Germany,[149] Britain,[150] Netherlands,[151] Norway,[152] Sweden[153] and Switzerland.[154][needs update]

Technology
As a vertically integrated manufacturer, Tesla has had to master multiple technology domains, including batteries, electric motors, sensors, and artificial intelligence.

Batteries

Tesla Supercharger in West Hartford, Connecticut
Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not use individual large battery cells, but thousands of small, cylindrical, lithium-ion commodity cells like those used in consumer electronics. It uses a version of these cells that is designed to be cheaper to manufacture and lighter than standard cells by removing some safety features. According to Tesla, these features are redundant because of the advanced thermal management system and an intumescent chemical in the battery to prevent fires.[155] Panasonic is the sole supplier of the cells for Model S, Model X, and Model 3 and cooperates with Tesla in the Gigafactory 1's '21â€“70' cells.[156]

In February 2016, Tesla battery cell costs were estimated at US$200 per kWh.[46] Tesla indicated later in 2016 that their battery cells cost less than $190/kWh.[157] Still later that year Argonne Labs estimated $163/kWh at a production rate of 500,000 packs per year.[158][159] In the 2018 Tesla Shareholder meeting, Elon Musk stated battery cell cost could be $100/kWh in 2018. 2020 would bring $100/kWh Tesla battery packs (as opposed to battery cell).[160]

The batteries are placed under the vehicle floor. This saves interior and trunk (boot) space but increases the risk of battery damage by debris or impact. The Model S has 0.25 in (6.4 mm) aluminum-alloy armor plate.[161] CTO Straubel expected batteries to last 10â€“15 years,[162] and discounts using electric cars to charge the grid (V2G) because the related battery wear outweighs economic benefit. He also prefers recycling over re-use for grid once they reach the end of their useful life for vehicles.[163][164] Since 2008, Tesla has worked with ToxCo/Kinsbursky to recycle worn out RoHS batteries, which will be an integral part of all Gigafactories.[165][166][167]

Motors
Tesla makes two kinds of electric motors. Their oldest currently-produced design is a three-phase four-pole AC induction motor with a copper rotor[168] (which inspired the Tesla logo), which is used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X. Newer, higher-efficiency permanent magnet motors[clarification needed] are used in the Model 3, Model Y, Semi, and the front motor of newer (early 2019 and onward) versions of the Model S and X.[169]

Autopilot
Main article: Tesla Autopilot
See also: Autonomous car and Connected car
Tesla Autopilot provides semi-autonomous driver assist beginning in September 2014. Tesla replaced its sensors and software in 2016 (Hardware version 2, or "HW2"). As of 2017, Autopilot included adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, emergency braking, Autosteer (semi-automated steering), Autopark (parallel and perpendicular parking) and Summon (recalling the vehicle from a parking place).[170][171] HW2 includes eight cameras and twelve ultrasonic sensors, in addition to forward-facing radar.[172] HW2.5 was released in mid-2017 that upgraded HW2 with a second GPU and, for the Model 3 only, a driver-facing camera.[173] HW3 were first installed in Model S and X's in q1 2019 and Model 3 followed quickly

At the end of 2016, Tesla expected to demonstrate full autonomy by the end of 2017,[174][175] which is now expected in 2019.[176] In April 2017 Musk predicted that in around two years drivers would be able to sleep in their vehicle while it drives itself.[177]

In April 2019, Tesla announced that all cars, including the Tesla Model 3, will include autopilot moving forward.[178] [179]

Glass
In November 2016, the company announced the Tesla glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3 and for use in SolarCity roof tiles announced in October 2016.[180] The tiles contain an embedded solar collector, and are one-third lighter than standard roof tiles.[181]

See also: Tesla Roadster (2008)
As of January 2019, Tesla offers three car models: the Model S, Model X and Model 3. The firm's first vehicle, the first-generation Tesla Roadster is no longer sold.

Production
Model S
Main article: Tesla Model S
The Model S is a five-door liftback sedan. Deliveries began on June 22, 2012.[184] The first delivery in Europe took place in August 2013.[185] Deliveries in China began in April 2014.[186] First deliveries of the right-hand-drive model destined for the UK, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan came in 2014.[187] As of August 2019, the Model S has two configurations: the Model S Long Range, and the Model S Performance with EPA ranges of 375 miles (604 km), and 345 miles (555 km) respectively.[188]


Norway is the Model S' largest European market due to the country's comprehensive incentives for the adoption of pure electric cars.
With an estimated 50,931 units sold in 2016, the Model S ranked was the world's best-selling plug-in car for the second year in a row.[64][65] As of September 2018, the Model S, with global sales of 250,000 units, ranks as the world's second best selling plug-in electric car in history after the Nissan Leaf (over 350,000 units).[104][105][107][189][190]

Other concepts
In 2016, Musk indicated he hoped to one day produce a car cheaper than the Model 3:[265][266]

There will be future cars that will be even more affordable down the road . . . With fourth generation and smaller cars and what not, we'll ultimately be in a position where everyone can afford the car.

â€”â€‰Elon Musk at the Future Transport Solutions conference in Oslo, April 21, 2016
Musk wanted the first three models to spell "SEX", but Ford owns the trademark to "Model E",[267] so he settled for "S3XY" by making the Model Y.[268]

On July 20, 2016, Musk detailed his new master plan for Tesla. It includes more affordable cars produced in higher volume, solar-power roofs, mid-size vehicles, SUVs and pickup trucks, as well as the refinement of autonomous vehicles and the creation of a sharing economy, in which cars can be active while the owner is not using them.[269] Tesla intends to build a minibus on the Model X platform.[270] In May 2017, Musk indicated that he might favor a 10-12 passenger version of the Model X over a dedicated minibus design.[271]

At the company's annual shareholder meeting in June 2018, Musk revealed Tesla's intention to enter a new market segment, offering a compact hatchback in "less than five years".[272][273] He provided no details, and dodged a question about also producing a subcompact. Musk also put to rest hopes for a Tesla motorcycle, saying "weâ€™re not going to do motorcycles".[274] However, in November 2019 during the unveiling of the Tesla Cybertruck, Musk also unveiled a Tesla ATV that was capable of charging from the cargo bed of the Cybertruck.[275]

It also produces Model 3 battery packs and drivetrains.[324] The factory received substantial subsidies from the local and state governments.[325] In August 2018, Karl Hansen, a former member of the company's security team, filed a whistleblower tip with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the tip, he alleged that Tesla suppressed an internal investigation into various criminal activities at the Nevada Gigafactory. Hansen said that the company refused to tell the DEA about several employees who were allegedly moving cocaine and crystal methamphetamine on behalf of a Mexican drug cartel. He also said that the company tried to get him to not report a $37 million theft of raw materials. Additionally, he said the company fired an employee who reported the theft, and gave the reason that the employee was "not a Tesla team player."[326]

The Gigafactory 2 is located in Buffalo, New York on the site of a former Republic Steel plant. It is operated by Tesla's SolarCity unit. The factory is a $750 million, 1.2-million-square-foot (0.11 km2) facility that directly employs 500 workers. Tesla partnered with Panasonic to assemble photovoltaic panel modules. Tesla received incentives to locate the factory in Buffalo through the Buffalo Billion program.[327][328][329][330] As of August 2017, the factory added production of solar tiles for the Tesla Solar Roof.[331] In January 2018, Tesla announced, after testing on employees' roofs, that it would begin installing the Tesla Solar Roof on customers' homes "within the next few months".[332] Version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof was announced in October 2019, with this version achieving economic viability to be cost competitive for installations where a new roof is needed and residential solar power is desired. Production ramp up is expected to occur into 2020 as Tesla works through anticipated ramp-up issues with the new mass manufactured and mass installed product.[333]

Toyota RAV4 EV second generation
Tesla and Toyota announced in July 2010 an agreement to develop a second generation of the compact Toyota RAV4 EV.[382] A second generation RAV4 EV demonstrator was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show. Toyota built 35 of these converted RAV4s (Phase Zero vehicles) for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. The lithium metal-oxide battery and other powertrain components were supplied by Tesla.[383][384] In August 2012, the production version RAV4 EV was unveiled; the battery pack, electronics and powertrain components are similar to those used in the Tesla Model S sedan launched in June 2012, and the Phase Zero vehicles used components from the Roadster.[385][386]

The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced.[387] The RAV4 EV hasn't been on the market since 2014 and there aren't any known plans to revive the model.[388]

Lawsuits and controversies
Main article: Lawsuits and Controversies of Tesla, Inc.
From 2008 to 2018 there have been many lawsuits filed by and against Tesla.

Securities Litigation Relating to SolarCityâ€™s Financial Statements and Guidance
On March 28, 2014, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against SolarCity and two of its officers. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SolarCity's securities from March 6, 2013 to March 18, 2014. On March 8, 2018, the Court upheld the District Court ruling of dismissal and judgment in Tesla's favor. The case is concluded.[396]

Securities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition
Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging the company's acquisition of SolarCity. Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla's board of directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneysâ€™ fees, and costs. The case is set for trial in March 2020.[396]

Securities Litigation Relating to Production of Model 3 Vehicles
On October 10, 2017, a stockholder class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, two of its current officers, and a former officer. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from May 4, 2016 to October 6, 2017.[396] This lawsuit was dismissed in Teslas' favor in March 2019[397].

Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award
On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors as then constituted, alleging that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan.[396]

Securities Litigation related to Potential Going Private Transaction
Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Elon Musk's August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of the suits are now pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects, they each purport to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related to Mr. Musk's statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla's securities. The hearing on the motion to dismiss is tentatively set for June 20, 2019.[396]

Between October 17, 2018 and November 9, 2018, five derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors as then constituted in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction. These cases have been stayed pending resolution of the stockholder class action.[396]

Settlement with SEC related to Potential Going Private Transaction
On October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the â€œSECâ€) relating to Elon Musk's prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. Without admitting or denying any of the SEC's allegations, and with no restriction on Mr. Musk's ability to serve as an officer or director on the Board (other than as its Chair), among other things, Tesla and Mr. Musk paid civil penalties of $20 million each and agreed that an independent director will serve as Chair of the Board for at least three years.[396]

Product issues
Recalls
As of March 2018, Tesla had issued two product recalls for the Roadster, six for the Model S and two for the Model X.[398]

On April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and "prevent the vehicles from moving".[399][400]

On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion-susceptible power steering bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use "increased force" to control the vehicle.[401]

Crashes and fires
See also: Tesla Model S fire incidents and Tesla Autopilot Â§ Serious crashes
On October 1, 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the "direct impact of a large metallic object to one of the 16 modules within the Model S battery pack."[402] On November 6, 2013, a Tesla Model S on Interstate 24 near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, caught fire after it struck a tow hitch on the roadway, causing damage beneath the vehicle. Tesla said that it would conduct its own investigation,[403] and as a result of these incidents, announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[404]

On January 4, 2014, a Tesla Model S in Norway caught fire while charging at one of Tesla's supercharger stations and was completely destroyed. No one was injured.[405]

On March 28, 2014, NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after the automaker said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[406] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6 have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[407]

A Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer on May 7, 2016, in Williston, Florida, while the vehicle was in autopilot mode. The driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in autopilot mode.[408][409] The NHTSA investigated the accident and concluded: "A safety-related defect trend has not been identified at this time and further examination of this issue does not appear to be warranted."[410]

On May 8, 2018, two 18-year-olds, driver Barrett Riley and passenger Edgar Monserratt Martinez, died in a fire in Fort Lauderdale, Florida that started after crashing a Tesla Model S into a wall at 116 mph. Speed is believed to have been a factor in the crash.[411][412][413] Less than two months before the crash, it was reported that Riley's parents had a limiter installed to limit the speed to 85 mph, but it was removed at another Tesla service visit without the parents' knowledge. The removal of the limiter and alleged defective battery pack formed the basis of a lawsuit against Tesla by the estate of Edgar Monserratt Martinez. The lawsuit was filed on January 9, 2019.[414]

Maintenance costs, crash rates, and insurance costs
On June 4, 2017, the American Automobile Association raised insurance rates for Tesla owners following a report from the Highway Loss Data Institute. The report concluded that the Model S crashes 46% more often and is 50% more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles. Similarly, the Model X was concluded to crash 41% more often and to be 89% more expensive to repair than similar vehicles. As a result, AAA raised insurance rates on Tesla cars by 30%. Tesla said that the analysis is "severely flawed and not reflective of reality", however, Tesla failed to provide any contradictory numbers.[415] Shortly thereafter, Russ Rader, the spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, confirmed the AAA's analysis and that "Teslas get into a lot of crashes and are costly to repair afterward".[416][417]

Delays
Tesla has been criticized for repeatedly overpromising and underdelivering. Delivery dates for new vehicles and new vehicle features slipped on the Roadster, Model S, Model X and Model 3. Advanced technologies like the prospect of a large network of solar-powered supercharger stations (first installation was in 2012; only two were solar-powered as of late 2014) also lagged projections.[418]

In early October 2017, Musk had predicted that Model 3 production would be up to 5,000 units per week by December.[419] A month later, he revised that target to "sometime in March" 2018 due in part to difficulties with robots on the assembly line, but primarily due to problems with the battery module.[420] An analyst with Cowan and Company, a public relations firm, made this comment: "Elon Musk needs to stop over promising and under delivering".[421]

On September 24, 2018, Musk revealed on Twitter that Tesla will be building its own car carriers as the company is facing challenges due to logistics. Tesla is running into an acute shortage of car carrier trailers leading to a delay in the delivery.[422] In mid-November, with end-of-year buyer tax credits expiring in a little more than six weeks, Musk announced that the company was aggressively ramping up delivery capabilities with trucking contracts and even outright purchase of some trucking firms to deliver as many cars as possible before the deadline.[423]

Hacking
In August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system.[424] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[425] Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[426]

In September 2016, researchers at Tencent's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[427] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program[428] and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[429] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[430]

In January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[431][432]

In 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to benevolent hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 Hacking Event.[433]

Servicing
Tesla offers service at its service centers. If a center is not available, mobile technicians can perform most inspections and repairs. In 2016, Tesla recommended to have any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first.[434] In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: "your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes," and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[435]

The first units for each new model revealed design and manufacturing flaws, including the Model S and the Model X.[436][437] As the Tesla vehicle fleet grew, the number of service centers resulted in waiting periods for some owners.[438] Auto experts view the service delays as insignificant, as owners accept the challenges of servicing a new type of car.[438] Tesla does not provide service manuals except in jurisdictions that required them to do so.[439]

At the June 2018 shareholder meeting, Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla will soon start to open its first body shops in the top ten U.S. metropolitan areas, stocking some body parts, potentially allowing for same-day service.[440][needs update]

Lobbying activity
In response to constant state auto dealers associations lobbying to prevent Tesla from selling cars directly to the public, Tesla has lobbied in several states for the right to sell cars. In June 2017, Tesla made a "last-minute push near the end of the Albany legislative session to expand its sales force in New York."[441] New York State Legislature bill A.8248/S.6600 would allow Tesla to operate 20 sales locations in the state, up from its current 5. Automotive dealers attacked the bill, arguing that it would hurt their business because Tesla does not sell through dealers. According to the New York Law Journal, "Tesla . . . has its own in-house lobbyists, according to disclosures filed with the state's lobbying entity."[441] The bill did not get to the floor of either house.[442][443]

Board of directors
As of December 2018, the Tesla board of directors consists of:[444]

Robyn Denholm, Chairman of Tesla, Inc. CFO and Head of Strategy of Telstra
Elon Musk, CEO and Product Architect of Tesla; founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX; Chairman of SolarCity

Kimbal Musk, Co-founder of The Kitchen
James Murdoch, former CEO of 21st Century Fox
Linda Johnson Rice, CEO and Chairman of Johnson Publishing Company
Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.
A group of investors asked Tesla in a 2017 public letter to add two new independent directors to its board â€œwho do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Muskâ€.[445] The investors wrote that â€œfive of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement.â€[446] The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink.[446] At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors "should buy Ford stock" because "their governance is amazing.â€[446] Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members.[447]
