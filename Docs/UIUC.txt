History
Main article: History of the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign
Illinois Industrial University

The original University Hall, which stood until 1938, when it was replaced by Gregory Hall and the Illini Union. Pieces were used in the erection of Hallene Gateway dedicated in 1998.[15]
The University of Illinois, originally named "Illinois Industrial University", was one of the 37 universities created under the first Morrill Land-Grant Act, which provided public land for the creation of agricultural and industrial colleges and universities across the United States. Among several cities, Urbana was selected in 1867 as the site for the new school.[16][17] From the beginning, President John Milton Gregory's desire to establish an institution firmly grounded in the liberal arts tradition was at odds with many state residents and lawmakers who wanted the university to offer classes based solely around "industrial education".[18] The university opened for classes on March 2, 1868, and had two faculty members and 77 students.[19]


John Milton Gregory, the university's first president
The Library, which opened with the school in 1868, started with 1,039 volumes. Subsequently, President Edmund J. James, in a speech to the board of trustees in 1912, proposed to create a research library. It is now one of the world's largest public academic collections.[17][20][21] In 1870, the Mumford House was constructed as a model farmhouse for the school's experimental farm. The Mumford House remains the oldest structure on campus.[22] The original University Hall (1871) was the fourth building built; it stood where the Illini Union stands today.[23]

University of Illinois
In 1885, the Illinois Industrial University officially changed its name to the "University of Illinois", reflecting its agricultural, mechanical, and liberal arts curriculum.[18]

During his presidency, Edmund J. James (1904â€“1920) is credited for building the foundation for the large Chinese international student population on campus.[24][25][26][27] James established ties with China through the Chinese Minister to the United States Wu Ting-Fang.[27] In addition, during James's presidency, class rivalries and Bob Zuppke's winning football teams contributed to campus morale.[17]


Statue on campus titled "Alma Mater" by Lorado Taft
Alma Mater, a prominent statue on campus created by alumnus Lorado Taft, was unveiled on June 11, 1929. It was established from donations by the Alumni Fund and the classes of 1923â€“1929.[28]

Like many universities, the economic depression slowed construction and expansion on the campus. The university replaced the original university hall with Gregory Hall and the Illini Union. After World War II, the university experienced rapid growth. The enrollment doubled and the academic standing improved.[29] This period was also marked by large growth in the Graduate College and increased federal support of scientific and technological research. During the 1950s and 1960s the university experienced the turmoil common on many American campuses. Among these were the water fights of the fifties and sixties.[30]

University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign
By 1967 the University of Illinois system consisted of a main campus in Champaign-Urbana and two Chicago campuses, Chicago Circle (UICC) and Medical Center (UIMC), and people began using "Urbanaâ€“Champaign" or the reverse to refer to the main campus specifically. The university name officially changed to the "University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign" around 1982. While this was a reversal of the commonly used designation for the metropolitan area, "Champaign-Urbana," most of the campus is located in Urbana. The name change established a separate identity for the main campus within the University of Illinois system, which today includes campuses in Springfield (UIS) and Chicago (UIC) (formed by the merger of UICC and UIMC).

In 1998, the Hallene Gateway Plaza was dedicated. The Plaza features the original sandstone portal of University Hall, which was originally the fourth building on campus.[23] In recent years, state support has declined from 4.5% of the state's tax appropriations in 1980 to 2.28% in 2011, a nearly 50% decline.[31] As a result, the university's budget has shifted away from relying on state support with nearly 84% of the budget now coming from other sources.[32]

On March 12, 2015, the Board of Trustees approved the creation of a medical school, being the first college created at Urbanaâ€“Champaign in over 60 years.[33][34][35] The Carle-Illinois College of Medicine began classes in 2018.[36]

Campus

Main article: Campus of the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign
See also: Campustown (Champaign, Illinois)
The main research and academic facilities are divided almost evenly between the twin cities of Urbana and Champaign, which form part of the Champaignâ€“Urbana metropolitan area. The College of Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences' research fields stretch south from Urbana and Champaign into Savoy and Champaign County. The university maintains formal gardens and a conference center in nearby Monticello at Allerton Park. Four main quads compose the center of the university and are arranged from north to south. The Beckman Quadrangle and the John Bardeen Quadrangle occupy the center of the Engineering Campus. Boneyard Creek flows through the John Bardeen Quadrangle, paralleling Green Street. The Beckman Quadrangle, named after Arnold Orville Beckman, is primarily composed of research units and laboratories, and features a large solar calendar consisting of an obelisk and several copper fountains. The Main Quadrangle and South Quadrangle follow immediately after the John Bardeen Quad. The former makes up a large part of the Liberal Arts and Sciences portion of the campus, while the latter comprises many of the buildings of the College of ACES spread across the campus map.[37]

The campus is known for its landscape and architecture, as well as distinctive landmarks.[38] It was identified as one of 50 college or university "works of art" by T.A. Gaines in his book The Campus as a Work of Art.[39] The campus also has a number of buildings and sites on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places including Harker Hall, Astronomical Observatory, Louise Freer Hall, the Main Library, the Experimental Dairy Farm Historic District, and the Morrow Plots. The University of Illinois Willard Airport is one of the few airports owned by an educational institution.[40]

Sustainability
In October 2011, the Sustainable Endowments Institute gave the campus a grade of B for sustainability in its 2011 College Sustainability Report Card. Strengths noted in the report included the campus's adoption of LEED gold standards for all new construction and major renovations and its public accessibility to endowment investment information. The university makes a list of endowment holdings and its shareholder voting record available to the public. The weaknesses are areas such as student involvement and investment priorities. The Student Sustainability Committee is empowered to allocate funding from a clean energy technology fee and a sustainable campus environment fee,[41] while the university aims to optimize investment return but has not made any public statements about investigating or investing in renewable energy funds or community development loan funds. However, the biggest weakness of the university's sustainability is its shareholder engagement, as the university has not made any public statements about active ownership or a proxy voting policy.[42]

Currently, the University of Illinois has 11 LEED certified buildings. Three of these are platinum certified (Business Instructional Facility, Lincoln Hall, and Bousfield Hall). Three are gold (National Petascale Computing Facility, Nugent Hall, Wassaja Hall). The rest are silver (Ikenberry Dining Hall, Evers Laboratory, Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory, Illinois Fire Service Institute, and Huff Hall).[43]

In his remarks on the creation of the Office of Sustainability in September 2008, Chancellor Richard Herman stated, "I want this institution to be the leader in sustainability."[44] In February 2008, he signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment, committing the University of Illinois to take steps "in pursuit of climate neutrality."[45]

Sexual harassment and 2018 lawsuit
In September 2018, a lawsuit was filed against the former head of the East Asian Language and Culture Department at the university, alleging "a reign of terror that includes accusations of preying on young Chinese women and sexually assaulting students."[46] Former students and another professor are suing Gary Xu, who worked at the university from 2006 until 2018, when he was â€œallowed to resign.â€ The lawsuit claims Xu specifically targeted female Chinese students, who often depended on the university for their visa status. He allegedly raped and beat one of his students repeatedly.[47] The lawsuit states that after the university prepared a report on Xu's violent abuse of students, he was allowed to remain on the faculty as a professor at full pay for two years, and then the university gave him a $10,000 departure bonus when he resigned.

An investigation by ProPublica and National Public Radio (NPR Illinois) in August 2019 revealed numerous instances of "allegations of harassment and sexual misconduct" against professors and an administrator at the university, none of which were publicly reported.[48] Several are still employed or affiliated with the university.

The Leadership Certificate is a multi-semester structured program which aims to develop students' leadership skills through different kinds of curricula and programs.[50]

Admissions
Admission to UIUC is rated as "more selective" by U.S. News & World Report.[51] Admissions differ between the different colleges/schools in the university. The School of Social Work has the lowest ranges with the middle 50% range of the ACT at 24â€“27, and the middle 50% range of the SAT is 1150â€“1350 (out of 1600; for critical reading and math only). The middle 50% high school class rank is 74â€“90%.[52] The schools start to make a more significant increase with the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The middle 50% range for the ACT is 27â€“32, the SAT (no writing) is 1320â€“1450, and the high school class rank is 85â€“97%.[52] The middle 50% range for the ACT and SAT (no writing) for the Gies College of Business are 28â€“32, 1320â€“1440 and the high school class rank is 88â€“97%.[52] The most selective college is the College of Engineering. The middle 50% range for the ACT is 31â€“34, the SAT (no writing) is 1400â€“1520, and the high school class rank is 92â€“99%.[52]

For the freshmen who were admitted for the 2018 school year, the middle 50% range of the ACT composite was 27â€“33.[52] The middle 50% range for the SAT was 1270-1480.

Distance learning
In addition to the university's Illinois Online platform, in 2015 the university entered into a partnership with the Silicon Valley educational technology company Coursera to offer a series of master's degrees and specialization courses, currently including more than 70 joint learning classes. In August 2015, the Master of Business Administration program was launched through the platform.[53] On March 31, 2016, Coursera announced the launch of the Master of Computer Science in Data Science from the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign.[54] At the time, the university's computer-science graduate program was ranked fifth in the United States by U.S. News & World Report.[55] On March 29, 2017, the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign launched their Master's in Accounting (iMSA) program, now called the Master of Science in Accountancy (iMSA) program. The iMSA program is led through live sessions, headed by UIUC faculty.[56]

Similar to the university's on-campus admission policies, the online master's degrees offered by The University of Illinois through Coursera also have strict admission requirements. All applicants must hold a bachelor's degree, and have earned a 3.0 GPA or higher in the last two years of study. Additionally, all applicants must prove their proficiency in English.[57][58][57]

Student life
Enrollment
As of spring 2018, the university had 45,813 students.[119] As of 2015, over 10,000 students were international students, and of them 5,295 were Mainland Chinese.[120] The university also recruits students from over 100 countries[121][122] among its 32,878[123] undergraduate students and 10,245[123] graduate and professional students.[122] The gender breakdown is 55% men, 45% women.[122] UIUC in 2014 enrolled 4,898 students from China, more than any other American university. They comprise the largest group of international students on the campus, followed by South Korea (1,268 in fall 2014) and India (1,167). Graduate enrollment of Chinese students at UIUC has grown from 649 in 2000 to 1,973 in 2014.[124]

Student organizations

The Student Union Building called Illini Union
The university has over 1,000 active registered student organizations,[125] showcased at the start of each academic year during Illinois's "Quad Day." Registration and support is provided by the Student Programs & Activities Office, an administrative arm established in pursuit of the larger social, intellectual, and educative goals of the Illini Student Union. The Office's mission is to "enhance ... classroom education," "meet the needs and desires of the campus community," and "prepare students to be contributing and humane citizens."[126] Beyond student organizations, The Daily Illini is a student-run newspaper that has been published for the community of since 1871. The paper is published by Illini Media Company, a not-for-profit which also prints other publications, and operates WPGU 107.1 FM, a student-run commercial radio station. The Varsity Men's Glee Club is an all-male choir at the University of Illinois that was founded in 1886.[127] The Varsity Men's Glee Club[128] is one of the oldest glee clubs in the United States as well as the oldest registered student organisation at the University of Illinois. As of 2018, the University also has the largest chapter of Alpha Phi Omega with over 340 active members.[129]

Greek life
Main article: List of social fraternities and sororities at UIUC
There are 59 fraternities and 38 sororities on campus.[130] Of the approximately 30,366 undergraduates, 3,463 are members of sororities and 3,674 are members of fraternities.[131] The Greek system at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign has a system of self-government. While staff advisors and directors manage certain aspects of the Greek community, most of the day-to-day operations of the Greek community are governed by the Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council.[132] A smaller minority of fraternities and sororities fall under the jurisdiction of the Black Greek Council and United Greek Council; the Black Greek Council serves "historically black" Greek organizations while the United Greek council comprises other multicultural organizations.[133][134] Many of the fraternity and sorority houses on campus are on the National Register of Historic Places.

Student government

Foellinger Auditorium
U of I has an extensive history of past student governments. Two years after the university opened in 1868, John Milton Gregory and a group of students created a constitution for a student government. Their governance expanded to the entire university in 1873, having a legislative, executive, and judicial branch. For a period of time, this government had the ability to discipline students. In 1883, however, due to a combination of events from Gregory's resignation to student-faculty infighting, the government formally dissolved itself via plebiscite.[135]

It wasn't until 1934, when the Student Senate, the next university-wide student government, was created. A year before, future U of I Dean of Students, Fred H. Turner and the university's Senate Committee on Student Affairs gave increased power to the Student Council, an organization primarily known for organizing dances. A year after, the Student Council created a constitution and became the Student Senate, under the oversight of the Committee on Student Affairs. This Student Senate would last for 35 years.[136] The Student Senate changed its purpose and name in 1969, when it became the Undergraduate Student Association (UGSA). It no longer was a representational government, instead becoming a collective bargaining agency. It often worked with the Graduate Student Association to work on various projects[137]

In 1967, Bruce A. Morrison and other U of I graduates founded the Graduate Student Association (GSA). GSA would last until 1978, when it merged with the UGSA to form the Champaign-Urbana Student Association (CUSA).[138][139] CUSA lasted for only 2 years when it was replaced by the Student Government Association (SGA) in 1980. SGA lasted for 15 years until it became the Illinois Student Government (ISG) in 1995. ISG lasted until 2004.[139]

The current university student government, created in 2004, is the Illinois Student Senate, a combined undergraduate and graduate student senate with 54 voting members. The student senators are elected by college and represent the students in the Urbanaâ€“Champaign Senate (which comprises both faculty and students), as well as on a variety of faculty and administrative committees, and are led by an internally elected executive board of a President, External Vice President, Internal Vice President, and Treasurer. As of 2012, the executive board is supported by an executive staff consisting of a Chief of Staff, Clerk of the Senate, Parliamentarian, Director of Communications, Intern Coordinator, and the Historian of the Senate.[140]

Residence halls
Main article: UIUC Residence Halls

Busey-Evans Residence Halls is one of many buildings on the NRHP
University housing for undergraduates is provided through twenty-four residence halls in both Urbana and Champaign. Incoming freshmen are required to live in student housing (campus or certified) their first year on campus. Graduate housing is usually offered through two graduate residence halls, restricted to students who are sophomores or above, and through three university-owned apartment complexes. Some undergraduates choose to move into apartments or the Greek houses after their second year. There are a number of private dormitories around campus, as well as 15 private, certified residences that partner with the university to offer a variety of different housing options, including ones that are cooperatives, single-gender or religiously-affiliated.[141] The university is known for being one of the first universities to provide accommodations for students with disabilities.[142] Currently, most first-year students with disabilities will live in Nugent Hall, supported by the Beckwith Residential Support Services.[143] In 2015, the University of Illinois announced that they would be naming its newest residence hall after Carlos Montezuma also known as Wassaja. Wassaja is the first Native American graduate and is believed to be one of the first Native Americans to receive a medical degree.[144]

Libraries and museums
See also: University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign University Library, Main Library (University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign), Spurlock Museum, Krannert Center for the Performing Arts, Grainger Engineering Library, and Krannert Art Museum

Krannert Museum of Art
The campus library system is one of the largest public academic collections in the world.[20] Among universities in North America, only the collections of Harvard are larger.[145] Currently, the University of Illinois' 20+ departmental libraries and divisions hold more than 24 million items, including more than 12 million print volumes.[20] As of 2012, it had also the largest "browsable" university library in the United States, with 5 million volumes directly accessible in stacks in a single location.[146] University of Illinois also has the largest public engineering library (Grainger Engineering Library) in the country.[147][20][148] In addition to the main library building, which houses nearly 10[quantify] subject-oriented libraries, the Isaac Funk Family Library on the South Quad serves the College of Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences and the Grainger Engineering Library Information Center serves the College of Engineering on the John Bardeen Quad.


Main Library and home to Rare Book & Manuscript Library
Residence Hall Library System is one of three in the nation.[149][150] The Residence Hall Libraries were created in 1948 to serve the educational, recreational, and cultural information needs of first and second year undergraduate students residing in the residence halls, and the living-learning communities within the residence halls. The collection also serves University Housing staff as well as the larger campus community, including undergraduate and graduate students, and university faculty and staff.[151] The Rare Book & Manuscript Library (RBML) is one of the Special collections units within the University Library.[152] The RBML is one of the largest special collections repositories in the United States.[153][154][155][156]

The university has several museums, galleries, and archives which include Krannert Art Museum, Sousa Archives and Center for American Music and Spurlock Museum. Gallery and exhibit locations include Krannert Center for the Performing Arts and at the School of Art and Design.

Recreation

Campus Recreation Center East
The campus has two main recreation facilities, the Activities and Recreation Center (ARC) and the Campus Recreation Center â€“ East (CRCE). Originally known as the Intramural Physical Education Building (IMPE) and opened in 1971, IMPE was renovated in 2006 and reopened in August 2008 as the ARC.[157] The renovations expanded the facility, adding 103,433 square feet to the existing structure and costing $54.9 million. This facility is touted by the university as "one of the country's largest on-campus recreation centers." CRCE was originally known as the Satellite Recreation Center, and was opened in 1989. The facility was renovated in 2005 to expand the space and update equipment, officially reopening in March 2005 as CRCE.[158]

Transportation
The bus system that operates throughout the campus and community is operated by the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District. The MTD receives a student-approved transportation fee from the university, which provides unlimited access for university students. In addition, the university pays for universal access for all its faculty and staff.

Six daily Amtrak trains connect Champaign-Urbana with Chicago and Carbondale (IL). The City of New Orleans train also serves Memphis, Jackson, Mississippi, and New Orleans.

Willard Airport, opened in 1954 and is named for former University of Illinois president Arthur Cutts Willard. The airport is located in Savoy. Willard Airport is home to University research projects and the university's Institute of Aviation, along with flights from American Airlines.

Athletics
Main article: Illinois Fighting Illini

Primarily used as Athletics logo (2014â€“17), became the campus-wide logo in 2017[159]
U of I's Division of Intercollegiate Athletics fields teams for ten men's and eleven women's varsity sports. The university participates in the NCAA's Division I. The university's athletic teams are known as the Fighting Illini. The university operates a number of athletic facilities, including Memorial Stadium for football, the State Farm Center for men's and women's basketball, and the Atkins Tennis Center for men's and women's tennis. The men's NCAA basketball team had a dream run in the 2005 season, with Bruce Weber's Fighting Illini tying the record for most victories in a season. Their run ended 37â€“2 with a loss to the North Carolina Tar Heels in the national championship game. Illinois is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games are: Illinois Loyalty, the school song, Oskee Wow Wow, the fight song, and Hail to the Orange, the alma mater.


Memorial Stadium with the State Farm Center in the background
On October 15, 1910, the Illinois football team defeated the University of Chicago Maroons with a score of 3â€“0 in a game that Illinois claims was the first homecoming game, though several other schools claim to have held the first homecoming as well.[160][161] On November 10, 2007, the unranked Illinois football team defeated the No. 1 ranked Ohio State football team in Ohio Stadium, the first time that the Illini beat a No. 1 ranked team on the road.

The University of Illinois Ice Arena is home to the university's club college ice hockey team competing at the ACHA Division I level and is also available for recreational use through the Division of Campus Recreation. It was built in 1931 and designed by Chicago architecture firm Holabird and Root, the same firm that designed the University of Illinois Memorial Stadium and Chicago's Soldier Field. It is located on Armory Drive across from the Armory. The structure features 4 rows of bleacher seating in an elevated balcony that runs the length of the ice rink on either side. These bleachers provide seating for roughly 1,200 fans, with standing room and bench seating available underneath. Because of this set-up the team benches are actually directly underneath the stands.[162]

In 2015, the university began Mandarin Chinese broadcasts of its American football games as a service to its Chinese international students.[120]

Chief Illiniwek
Main article: Chief Illiniwek
Chief Illiniwek, also referred to as "The Chief," was from 1926 to 2007 the official symbol of the University of Illinois in university intercollegiate athletic programs. The Chief was typically portrayed by a student dressed in Sioux regalia. Several groups protested that the use of a Native American figure and indigenous customs in such a manner was inappropriate and promoted ethnic stereotypes. In August 2005 the National Collegiate Athletic Association expressed disapproval of the university's use of a "hostile or abusive" image.[163] While initially proposing a consensus approach to the decision about the Chief, the board in 2007 decided that the Chief, its name, image and regalia should be officially retired. Nevertheless, the controversy continues on campus with some students unofficially maintaining the Chief. Complaints continue that indigenous students feel insulted when images of the Chief continue to be present on campus.[164] The effort to resolve the controversy by the current chancellor has included the work of a committee that issued a report of its "critical conversations" that included over 600 participants representing all sides, which remain sharply divided.[165]
